# Ender 3 (Pro) Printbed

This is an attempt of uniting print surface and heating element into a single PCB. Both heating traces and temperature sensing are located on the bottom of the PCB, while the top surface is exposed FR4 (no copper, no soldermask). 

A LED on top indicates when the heatbed is being active. Temperature sensing uses a JST XH 2-pin connector, while the heating wires can either be directly soldered, or connected with a Amass XT30U connector. Target operating voltage/power: 24V 240W.

This is a WIP and shouldn't be used just yet - I am still waiting for my Ender 3 Pro to arrive to finalize the design and order protos.
